My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting 
an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another 
drawing:

I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. 
They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:

The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa 
constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to 
geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up 
what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the 
failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand 
anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever 
explaining things to them.
