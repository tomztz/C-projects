Music had stirred him like that.  Music had troubled him many times.
But music was not articulate.  It was not a new world, but rather a new
chaos, that it created in us.  Words!  Mere words!  How terrible they
were!  How clear, and vivid, and cruel!  One could not escape from
them.  And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! [15] They seemed
to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a
music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute.  Mere words!
Was there anything so real as words?
